# 🩺 Obesity Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project predicts **obesity levels** based on lifestyle and demographic data.  
The dataset is obtained from [Kaggle - Obesity Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adeniranstephen/obesity-prediction-dataset), and the model uses **machine learning techniques** for classification.

The project includes:
- Data loading from Kaggle
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Encoding categorical features
- Feature scaling
- Model training & evaluation using **Random Forest Classifier**
- Insights visualization
